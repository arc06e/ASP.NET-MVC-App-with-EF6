  ##Description
  Welcome to my personal media database! I have built this ASP.NET MVC app with Entity Framework 6. I started this project so I could gain a deeper understanding of MVC design patterns 
  and learn how to interact with databases through Entity Framework. 
  
  ##Current Features
  *Implements CRUD functionality
  *Utilizes both Models and ViewModels to allow users to both:
     -display data from multiple tables in one page
     -update multiple db tables in one submission

##Intended Improvements
Time permitting, I would love to add a new join table to record which movies are adapted from existing books and books which are in turn novelizations of existing movies. Beyond that, I would 
really enjoy incorporating TV shows and Radio programs with their own respective join tables which would indicate which were adapted from existing intellectual properties--we haven't even got to comic books yet!
